Regardless of whether one is involved in engineering, manufacturing, or quality control, improved navigation translates to accelerated progress.

Resize, Remember, and Review Faster in the Vault Thin Client

Vault 2026.1 presents a more innovative and efficient approach to managing file properties within the Thin Client environment. The introduction of a resizable property panel, accompanied by persistent panel settings, allows users to instantly view extended property values without the necessity to hover or scroll. This advancement not only conserves time but also mitigates frustration. Furthermore, enhanced caching substantially decreases load times when handling large assemblies, facilitating the revisitation of files without unnecessary waiting periods. The overall experience is quicker and more seamless, allowing users to concentrate on making decisions rather than encountering delays.
